  image: dp-admm.jpg
  description: Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a widely used tool for machine learning in distributed settings where a machine learning model is trained over distributed data sources through an interactive process of local computation and message passing. The goal of this paper is to provide differential privacy for ADMM-based distributed machine learning.
