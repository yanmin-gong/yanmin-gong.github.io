### Research Lab Info
The Networking Intelligence Security and Privacy (NISP) Lab at University of Texas at San Antonio, led by Dr. Yanmin Gong, is focused on in-depth understanding and basic design in security and privacy, machine learning, Internet of things, and wireless networks. Our research is motivated by the urgent need for secure and privacy-preserving solutions to allowing people to learn information as it was intended and stopping people from learning informationin ways it was not intended in the big data and AI era.
